		      <p id="question1">Q: Will you provide legal advice for what type of rental agreement I need?</p><br>
					<p id="answer1">A: Yes, as part of our services we not only draft or review a legal document, but also identify which rental agreement you need. We also explain any legal issues we might discover with your rental situation so that you are aware of your legal rights as a landlord, tenant or subtenant.</p><br>
					<p id="question2">Q: Besides a rental agreement, I need advice on a landlord-tenant situation, can you help me?</p><br>
					<p id="answer2">A: Yes. We o er flat fee legal consultations on landlord-tenant questions. You submit your legal question and factual scenario, then from the information you provide we generate a legal opinion based on relevant law.
						<br><br>The flat fee we quote will depend on the complexity of your legal issue. We schedule a phone or video call and provide you an answer or for an extra fee draft a written legal opinion.
						<br><br>Please be aware that our legal opinion will not necessarily give you a clear cut answer. This is the risk of litigation when both sides have a valid claim. An actual judicial decision can go either way depending on the facts, law, venue, behavior in court, presiding judge, etc. We do our best to present both sides of the argument based on material facts and law, but cannot guarantee an actual outcome.</p><br>
					<p id="question3">Q: Do you provide landlord-tenant representa- tion in Housing Court?</p><br>
					<p id="answer3">A: Unfortunately at this time we do not. We are currently working on developing this practice area and look forward to providing landlord-tenant legal services in the near future. Please check back frequently to see the new practice areas that we add.</p><br>

		<p>Before you rent your property to a tenant or subtenant, speak to a lawyer to reduce your liability. As a landlord or master tenant, help protect yourself from potential landlord-tenant issues by having a lawyer draft a residential lease agreement or sublease. As a landlord you want a lease to make sure there is a formal record of the agreement you have with your tenant. As a tenant you are responsible to the landlord so you definitely want a sublease with your subtenant just in case you need to protect yourself. The inverse is also true, if you are a tenant or subtenant and your landlord does not have a lease ready for you then give your landlord a lease form. Even if your landlord does have a lease form, have a lawyer review your lease before you sign anything. Whether you need a rental lease agreement drafted or as a prospective tenant want a lawyer to review your lease, it pays to formalize your agreement in writing. If you are about to enter or are currently in a landlord-tenant relationship without a written lease then you leave it up to the default law of your state or a judge to decide landlord-tenant issues. A residential lease or sublease makes it o cial and allows you to agree on lease terms such as the length of the lease, amount of rent or security deposit by putting it in writing. If you are a homeowner who wants to rent a room in your home to a tenant then you may need a room rental agreement. If you are looking to rent a driveway or garage in your house, a license agreement may be the best option. There are many di erent rental agreements to choose from. Even you are simply agreeing to split utilities between roommates and need a utilities agreement form, it makes sense to use a lawyer. Our flat fee lawyers o er low fees in comparison to hourly attorneys for New York and New Jersey. Our goal is to leave you satisfied you took the right steps to avoid potential landlord-tenant problems in the future.</p>
