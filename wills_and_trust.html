	      <h1 class="sans-serif">Common Questions</h1><br>
	      <p id="question1">Q: Do you draft any type of will or trust, or is there a limit?</p><br>
	      <p id="answer1">A: We will draft a last will and testament or trust specific to your legal needs, but there are limitations. We do have an estate value limit and do not draft complex estate planning documents
					<br><br>Complex estates require tax support that we do not currently o er, hence we typically do not handle complicated estate planning matters. Also, complex estate planning usually requires an hourly fee, our legal business model is based on flat law fees. This applies to both wills and rusts.
					<br><br>We welcome your inquiries and as we continue to develop our legal services this may change, but for now we maintain an estate value limit and deliver simple estate planning documents only.</p><br>
	      <p id="question2">Q: Can I choose your law firm to be an Executor or Trustee?</p><br>
	      <p id="answer2">A: At the present we do not accept o ers to be an executor of a last will and testament, or trustee of a trust. We will o er the opportunity to be your executor or trustee in the near future. Please check back with us if you still need these legal services.</p><br>
	      <p id="question3">Q: Do you o er additional services such as disinterested witness signing or estate administration?</p><br>
	      <p id="answer3">A: No, at this time we do not o er additional services besides the drafting of your estate plan documents. We do provide you with step-by- step instructions to help you make your last will valid in New York or New Jersey. We also do not provide estate administration services at this time, only estate planning legal services.
					<br><br>However, we do provide a bundle discount if you need more than one estate planning document. Please visit our flat law fees page to learn more.</p><br>

			<p>Our estate planning legal services provide many options, the first satisfying the need to create a last will and testament. A last will allows you to choose who will receive your property and how you would like to transfer property to your heirs. It also provides instructions who will take care of your children and the person that will settle your a airs after you die. Another option we provide is to create a living trust also known as a revocable trust or inter vivos trust. This legal document allows you compile your assets in one place so your estate can be privately distributed in an e cient manner after you are gone. An advantage of a living trust is that it may help you avoid probate saving your family or loved ones time and money. Even an uncontested will requires probate administration, a trust does not. You can also have an irrevocable trust created which is when you give up control of your assets and provide instructions how it should be used for a beneficiary or beneficiaries. A key element of an irrevocable trust is to relinquish control of your assets and the right to change the language of the trust. A third but important option in estate planning is a health care proxy or living will. An advanced healthcare directive provides instruc- tions on what to do if you are hurt or disabled and cannot decide for yourself. It includes a durable power of attorney for healthcare decisions which instructs a trusted person what to do if you need lifesaving treatment, and also designates someone to make financial decisions when you are incapacitated. An estate planning bundle incorporates any legal documents that you want to have to protect your estate, yourself and your loved ones. When you give your family clarity and peace of mind it ensures that your assets are enjoyed by your heirs, not drained by court and legal costs. Transfer your ownership of your assets during your life or at the time of your death. A flat fee attorney can help set up an estate plan based on your specific needs usually for a fraction of the cost of an hourly attorney. We look forward to assisting you with your estate planning needs all within your budget.</p>
