	      <h1 class="sans-serif">Common Questions</h1><br>
	      <p class="question" id="question1">Q: What is the difference between a trademark and copyright?</p>
	      <p class="answer" id="answer1">A: The difference between a trademark and copyright is that a copyright protects your creation of original work while a trademark has more to do with protecting your business or brand than creativity.
					<br><br>When you file a copyright application with the federal government you protect an expression of an idea that is in a fixed form such as a book, recorded song or photograph. Although you do have rights to your original work once you create it, o cially filing a copyright application gives you additional legal protection.
					<br><br>Similarly, when you sell a service or product you have some rights, however offcially registering a business or brand name, logo or slogan with the government gives you nationwide protection of your mark and exclusive rights. The idea behind a trademark is to let the public recognize and associate your mark with a service or product to create brand loyalty or other business benefits. When you file a trademark with the govern- ment it helps stop others from selling goods or services with similar marks.</p><br>
	      <p class="question" id="question2">Q: Do you offer a discount for combined trademark and copyright services?</p>
	      <p class="answer" id="answer2">A: Yes, if you need to register your trademark and file a copyright application, we o er a bundle discount for combined services. These services do have to be purchased together, and you can include other legal services that you need as well. In fact, most of our legal services have discounts when you choose more than one deliverable. Please visit our flat law fees page to learn more about our pricing options and current discounts.</p><br>
	      <p class="question" id="question3">Q: Can you represent me in a trademark or copyright infringement matter?</p>
	      <p class="answer" id="answer3">A: No, at this time we do not offer any litigation services. Litigation typically requires hourly fees and we have not yet developed a flat fee legal model that incorporates litigation services. We are however working on it and plan to o er these services in the near future. Please check back with us at a later time as we develop our flat law fee business model to include additional legal services.
					<br><br>We can, however, provide you with a legal opinion on your infringement issue. This way you can assess your legal situation without necessarily committing to a lawsuit.
					<br><br>The flat fee we quote for a legal opinion will depend on the complexity of your legal issue. We schedule a phone or video call and provide you an answer or for an extra fee draft a written legal opinion.
					<br><br>Also, please be aware that our legal opinion will not necessarily give you a clear cut answer. This is the risk of litigation when both sides have a valid claim. An actual judicial decision can go either way depending on the facts, law, venue, behavior in court, presiding judge, etc. We do our best to present both sides of the argument based on material facts and laws, but cannot guarantee an actual outcome.</p><br>

		<p>A federally registered trademark or filed copyright claim can protect your intellectual property nationwide. When you trademark a business name, logo or slogan with the U.S. Patent and Trademark O ce (USPTO) you create a statutory legal presumption of ownership, an exclusive right to use the trademark and it puts the public on notice that you own the trademark. When you register a copyright it helps protect your creative work as an “original work of authorship,” establishes a public record of your copyright claim and gives you an exclusive right to exercise your copyright license. A copyright license allows you to transfer your ownership or invoke other rights such as reproducing or distributing copies of the work to the public for sale, or prepare derivative works based on your original intellectual work. Registering a trademark and copyright allows you to bring legal action against an infringer in federal court. Before you file a trademark application with the USPTO, a flat fee lawyer performs a trademark search. Once the UPSTO approves your trademark application, you have a federally registered trademark and can use the ® symbol. Similarly, once a copyright is accepted as an original, creative work that is fixed in a tangible form of expression by the U.S. Copyright O ce, your copyright registration is e ective. Whether you want to register a book you have written, sound recordings or any intellectual work make sure the details of your copyright application are handling properly. Our flat fee lawyers are here to help and look forward to registering your copyright or filing a trademark application. We can even help you get an international trademark for foreign protection. Give your intellectual property the benefits of trademark protection and copyright registration at a fraction of the cost of an hourly attorney.</p>
