	      <p class="question" id="question1">Q: Can I bundle small business legal services together for a bulk discount?</p>
	      <p class="answer" id="answer1">A: Yes you can, we o er bundled business legal services, ongoing monthly, quarterly or yearly plans and the option to consult with a small business lawyer when you need small business legal advice. You can also bundle other legal services such as trademark and copyright, or escrow attorney services if you want. Just ask us how we can help you achieve your small business legal needs.</p><br>
	      <p class="question" id="question2">Q: Can you represent me in commercial litigation?</p>
	      <p class="answer" id="answer2">A: Not at the moment, we have not yet fully developed this branch of our services. At the present we only focus on transactional matters in our small business practice area. We can provide you with a legal opinion on a small business issue, but we do not represent clients in court at this time.
					<br><br>The flat fee we quote for a legal opinion will depend on the complexity of your legal issue. We schedule a phone or video call and provide you an answer or for an extra fee draft a written legal opinion.
					<br><br>Also, please be aware that our legal opinion will not necessarily give you a clear cut answer. This is the risk of litigation when both sides have a valid claim. An actual judicial decision can go either way depending on the facts, law, venue, behavior in court, presiding judge, etc. We do our best to present both sides of the argument based on material facts and laws, but cannot guarantee an actual outcome.</p><br>
	      <p class="question" id="question3">Q: Will I work with the same lawyer each time?</p>
	      <p class="answer" id="answer3">A: If you select an all-inclusive service or ongoing legal plan, then we make every e ort to ensure you work with the same attorney each time. This means that he or she will be your point of contact whenever possible. Even if your assigned attorney is unavailable, they will review your file with the substitute attorney and follow up to make sure you are satisfied.
					<br><br>Of course people relocate, change careers or employers, but we do make an e ort to nurture a long-term business relationships by assigning you the same lawyer each time.</p><br>
