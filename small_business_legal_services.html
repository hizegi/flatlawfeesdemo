	      <p id="answer1">A: As attorneys we believe it is in your best interests to hire a real estate attorney for the purchase of your new home. In New York, buyers of real estate typically retain a real estate lawyer when they buy a home, especially first time home-buyers. In New Jersey, the practice differs depending where the property is located. There is no law in either jurisdiction that says you must hire a real estate lawyer, but it is probably a good idea to get a real estate lawyer before you enter into a contract of sale.<br><br>If you are purchasing a home for the first time and have no experience with real estate transactions why take the chance you might miss something? After all, you are about to make a serious financial commitment, make sure sure the purchase of your new home does not come with major problems.<br><br>With our flat fee legal services there are no hidden hourly fees so you can budget appropriately and still receive quality legal representation. Peace of mind is truly priceless.</p><br>
