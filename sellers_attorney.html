		  <div>
		    <h1 class="sans-serif">Common Questions</h1><br>
				<p id="question1">Q: Should I hire a real estate attorney for the sale of my property or represent myself?</p><br>
	      <p id="answer1">A: As attorneys we believe it is in your best interests to retain a real estate attorney.
					<br><br>In New York, sellers of real estate almost always use a real estate lawyer. In New Jersey, the practice di ers depending where you are. There is no law in either jurisdiction that requires you to get a real estate lawyer, but it is typically a good idea to find a real estate lawyer to work with especially if you have never conducted a real estate transac- tion before. After all, you have made a significant investment in your property, it’s probably a good idea to make sure the sale of your home goes through as best as possible.
					<br><br>With our flat fee legal services there are no hidden hourly fees so you can budget appropriately and still receive quality legal representation during the sale of your home. We believe peace of mind is priceless.</p><br>
	      <p id="question2">Q: What should I expect as a seller of real estate during the real estate transaction process?</p><br>
	      <p id="answer2">A: Once you accept a buyer’s o er, speak to your attorney and do not put anything in writing. Allow your buyer’s inspector access to find potential faults with the property. The buyer may request you make repairs prior to closing or reduce the purchase price.
					<br><br>Assuming you agree on which repairs to make or to reduce the purchase price, and other terms have been successfully negotiated, a real estate contract is signed by both parties. The buyer orders a title search report, obtains financing or provides proof of funds, and may need to get Board approval (coop) or handle another legal formality (condo).
					<br><br>When all conditions of the real estate transaction have been met, a real estate closing date is scheduled and you can move out. Permit the buyer a final walk-through before closing to inspect the condition of the property. During the real estate closing everything is finalized, certified payment is received and keys are released to the new homeowners. The property must be delivered “vacant” and in “broom clean” condition at closing.</p><br>
	      <p id="question3">Q: What happens if issues arise during the real estate transaction? Do I get charged more?</p><br>
	      <p id="answer3">A: Typical issues such as repair concerns, termite or pest inspection, reasonable negotiations on purchase price or contract terms do not incur additional charges.
					<br><br>However, if there are material issues that need to be resolved such as Certificate of Occupancy, Release of Liens, Code violations or other deal breakers, then yes, this is outside the scope of a standard real estate transaction and there are additional charges.
					<br><br>We will always o er you a fair flat fee for these additional legal services and you have the option to handle it yourself or use another attorney. Sometimes the buyer is motivated enough to be responsible for clearing title, these negotiations on your behalf do not incur additional charges.</p><br>		  </div>

		<p>When you have an accepted offer for your property as a seller you need a lawyer right away. A seller’s real estate lawyer will prepare a contract and incorporate the terms of your transaction into a written agreement. It is even recommended that you get a real estate lawyer before you sell your home or investment. This way once you have accepted an o er and need a real estate lawyer, you will be ready to go into contract immediately. As a seller, you are looking for a real estate lawyer that works quickly and e ciently. You want to use a lawyer that does not kill the deal. You also want to hire a real estate lawyer that consults with you on any property issues, advises you on your options and allows you to make the final decision. Once all legal and contractual requirements are met, a real estate closing is scheduled as the last major step. A real estate closing lawyer will be present to ensure you are properly represented at closing and will assist your lender, title agent or any other involved parties on your behalf. A flat low fee real estate lawyer for New York or New Jersey is better than paying a high hourly fee for comparable services. A lawyer that charges low flat fees will still provide dedicated legal representation. We are here to help you meet your budget and save on closing costs with an affordable real estate lawyer.</p>
