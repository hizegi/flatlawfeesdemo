	  <h1 class="sans-serif">Our flat law fees</h1>
	  <p>If you want to find low fee lawyers that charge a flat rate in New York or New Jersey look no further. Our services are geared to those individuals and businesses that need a reliable lawyer for an a ordable price.</p>
    <p>We pride ourselves on delivering services comparable to the law profession standard. The only di erence is we charge a flat fee – there are no hourly rates for the legal services listed on this website.</p>

	  <h1 class="sans-serif">How do we do it?</h1>
	  <p><em>We leverage smart technology.</em></p>
		<p>Our lawyers execute legal tasks wherever they are, coordinate with you online, and can access your file with the tap or swipe of a finger. It is after all the 21 st century, we work smarter not harder.
		<p><em>We value your time and our time.</em></p>
		<p>Rather than waste time on commuting, we o er our lawyers the flexibility of telecommuting. No need to waste precious hours stuck in tra c or on crowded public transportation. This way our lawyers have high morale and more time to focus on actual work.</p>
		<p>Same goes for you, we o er virtual meetings or phone consultations before, after or during regular business hours. No reason to take time o  or spend extra time traveling when you don’t have to.</p>
	  <p>Connect with us from the convenience of your home or office.</p>
		<p><em>We maintain low overhead when compared to the traditional law practice model.</em></p>
		<p>We avoid multiple rent commitments and unnecessary expenses, prefer to be wise with our budget and have changed with the times. We have a principle place of business and our multiple satellite office locations help us cover more territory, but we only incur expenses when these satellite facilities are used for actual legal services. It’s the best of both worlds as we provide the convenience of proximity without the need to staff these additional locations full-time.</p>
		<p><em>We pass our savings on to you so you spread the word about us.</em></p>
		<p>In this frugal manner we save money, which we pass on to you. By lowering our operation costs it helps everyone out. Plus we feel that once you use us and pass the word on to others of your positive experience, it will generate more business and turn into a win-win situation.</p>
		<p>No reason to be penny-wise, dollar foolish, right?</p>

	  <h1 class="sans-serif">Our quality services.</h1>
	  <p>Our services speak for themselves. We treat our clients with fairness and respect, this shows in our approach to lawyering.</p>
		<p>Regardless your income status or level of legal services we believe you deserve a positive experience.</p>
		<p>Just because we o er flat law fees for legal services does not mean you receive less service. Rather it means you receive a reliable lawyer for an a ordable price that delivers as promised.</p>

	  <h1 class="sans-serif">Our expanding business model.</h1>
	  <p>As our law practice grows we reinvest our earnings in order to grow our capabilities. Our goal is to continue expanding our legal presence into new jurisdictions and practice areas, more o ce locations, additional lawyers and ultimately the ability to accept more business.</p>
		<p>Please check back for new o ce locations and practice areas coming soon.</p>
