	      <h1 class="sans-serif">Common Questions</h1><br>
	        <p class="question" id="question1">Q: Are you my lawyer that handles negotiations with the bank or lender?</p>
	        <p class="answer" id="answer1">A: No, we do not handle actual negotiations of the terms of your mortgage commitment or loan. Although we would very much like to, we understand that when a person needs money to purchase a home they usually have little to no choice. They either agree to the loan or refuse to take it outright.
					<br><br>Most lenders will not alter their terms of a loan for a single residential purchase by an individual seeking to be a homeowner. The reality is that these documents have been drafted with meticulous precision by a team of lawyers to protect the lender’s interests and your business is not serious enough to warrant a contract modification.
					<br><br>If we thought it could make a di erence, we would zealously negotiate on your behalf, but it’s usually a take it or leave it situation. Keep your hard earned money and find a better financing deal if possible.
					</p>
	        <p class="question" id="question2">Q: If you don’t handle negotiations, what do you do?</p>
	        <p class="answer" id="answer2">A: We provide an explanation of the documents that you will eventually sign with your lender to finance your home purchase. These documents are complicated and may contain words or legal concepts that you are unfamiliar with. There is no shame in this, but to sign a long-term loan commitment you do not fully understand defies common sense. Basically, we simplify the loan document you are about to sign so you better understand it and can make an informed decision. We also advise you on your legal rights and risks, and answer any questions you may have.</p>
	        <p class="question" id="question3">Q: English is not my first language, do you provide an explanation in a foreign language?</p>
	        <p class="answer" id="answer3">A: Yes, once we have reviewed your loan documents and prepared an explanation in plain English we can have this written explanation translated in a language of your choice.</p>

    <p>Are you worried you do not understand your mortgage documents for the purchase of your home? Do you want to review your real estate loan documents with a lawyer before your closing so you feel more comfortable signing a long-term financial commitment? Thinking of refinancing or getting a line of credit but need legal advice on whether your new loan is better than your old loan? If so, our flat fee mortgage attorneys can help you understand the terms and conditions of your real estate loan agreement. Do not wait till the day of closing to ask important questions about your mortgage. At closing everybody is excited to finally conclude the real estate transac- tion that has been ongoing for months. Do not be a buyer that sits at the closing table and asks questions about their mortgage commitment that should have been asked earlier. Have an attorney explain your mortgage to you in a way you can understand it. Our mortgage lawyers review your entire real estate loan agreement and prepare a brief written explanation that you can read from the comfort of your home. We can also translate our written explanation into your native language if necessary. Our lawyers advise you on your legal rights and responsibilities so you are better informed before you sign your real estate loan commitment. Whether a mortgage, refinancing or a line of credit, our flat fee lawyers will review your real estate loan agreement so you don’t unwittingly enter into a deal that financially harms you.</p>
